This extension allows Administrators to display different themes for discussions with tags.

## Installation

This extension requires PHP 7.4 or higher.

    composer require yippy/flarum-tag-with-themes

## Flarum Tag with Themes

Currently the default Flarum design theme does not cater for different theme style with Tags that are assigned to the discussion. This was created to allow Administrators to change the entire themes with Tag Theming. Currently there is only two styles of themes, and in the future there can be additional themes.
