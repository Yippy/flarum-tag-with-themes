## Flarum Tag with Themes

Currently the default Flarum design theme does not cater for different theme style with Tags that are assigned to the discussion. This was created to allow Administrators to change the entire themes with Tag Theming. Currently there is only eight styles of themes, and in the future there can be additional themes.
